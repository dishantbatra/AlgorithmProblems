 You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone in the party. Your task is to find the stranger (celebrity) in party.
You will be given a square matrix M[][] where if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to complete the function getId() which finds the id of the celebrity if present else return -1. The function getId() takes two arguments, the square matrix M and its size N.
Here, M[i][i] will be equal to zero.
Note: Expected time complexity is O(N) with constant extra space.

    int getId(int M[][], int n)
